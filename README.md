	LE16 - Linear Editor for 16mm                                                       

WORKPRINT (formerly freekode) is a cutlist generator that allows
filmmakers to cut their 16mm film in Final Cut Pro and export a
valid cutlist without the use of Flex files or keycode burn-in.

Log your film, transfer it off a wall and cut. Then, when you're ready
to make a print, upload your project file (.xml) through WORKPRINT
and view your cutlist.

Stay tuned for better docs.
