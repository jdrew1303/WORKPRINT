	LE16 - Linear Editor for 16mm                                                       

WORKPRINT (formerly freekode) is a cutlist generator that allows
filmmakers to cut their 16mm film in Final Cut Pro and export a
valid cutlist without the use of Flex files or keycode burn-in.

Instructions:

1. Shoot film. 16mm.
2. Get it processed. 
	At this point you can do whatever you want with the footage. The minimum requirement is that you have a processed negative, but the advantages to getting a pring
3. Digitize the footage. 
	This is meant in the loosest of terms. If you want, you can project the negative on a wall and record it with a miniDV camera, a cellphone, whatever really. Using a crystal-sync projector will ensure the accuracy of the cutlist
